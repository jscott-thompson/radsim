# radsim
Simple radar simulation

`simpleRadarModel3.m` is the main driver for generating data for ML purposes.

Call `runtests` in Matlab to execute unit tests.

# Adding tests
Create a new script file ending in -Test.m. Use `assert` to check for correct functionality. See [Matlab unit testing documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-unit-test-framework.html) for more details.
